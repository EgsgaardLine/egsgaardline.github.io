    <p>Sadly, no more work on your pizza website.</p>
    <p>Try out CSS grid and some basic responsive features. Rember to resize the browser window to see if things work as intended.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Play the <a href=https://cssgridgarden.com />grid garden game</a> to get familiar with the CSS grid
            features.</li>
        <li>Use CSS grid to create a layout that looks like the image below (in a new HTML document): <img
                class="layout" src="images/responsiveLayout.jpg" alt="" /></li>
        <li>Arrange the animal pictures below, so on a full open browser window each picture takes up 25% of the width
            in a single row (space between pictures can be removed by letting them float left).</li>
        <li>Use media query to create a breakpoint at which the pictures order into two rows with two pictures in each.
        </li>
        <li>Add another breakpoint at which the pictures all seperate into four different rows.</li>
        <li>Create breakpoint(s) for the layout that you created in question 2, so that the layout is responsive. The
            layout should stack all elements/items when the borwser window size is maximally 600px wide.</li>
        <li>Complete the learning path on itslearning (videos, links, and exercises).</li>
